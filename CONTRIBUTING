# Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work:

* You MUST follow the [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/index.html);
* If you don't know about any of them, you should really read the recommendations;
* You MUST run the test suite;
* You MUST write (or update) unit tests;
* All public methods MUST return `$this` or a new class instance;
* You MUST write commit messages that make sense;
* You MUST [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request;
* You MUST [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) to "clean" your Pull Request;
* While creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Thanks in advance!
